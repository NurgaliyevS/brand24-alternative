# Slack Notifications Cron Job Setup

This guide explains how to set up a cron job to automatically send Slack notifications every 5-10 minutes.

## Overview

The cron job calls the `/api/cron/slack-notifications` endpoint, which:
1. Authenticates the request
2. Calls the Slack notifications API
3. Processes pending notifications
4. Provides detailed logging and monitoring

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required for cron job authentication
CRON_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Your app's base URL (used by the cron job)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Cron Job Setup

### Option 1: Using a Cron Service (Recommended)

#### Vercel Cron Jobs
If deploying on Vercel, add this to your `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/slack-notifications",
      "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### GitHub Actions
Create `.github/workflows/slack-notifications.yml`:

```yaml
name: Slack Notifications Cron
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'  # Every 5 minutes

jobs:
  slack-notifications:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Call Slack Notifications API
        run: |
          curl -X GET \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}" \
            https://your-domain.com/api/cron/slack-notifications
```

#### External Cron Services
- **Cron-job.org**: Free service for cron jobs
- **EasyCron**: Simple cron job service
- **SetCronJob**: Another free option

### Option 2: Server Cron (Linux/Mac)

Add to your crontab (`crontab -e`):

```bash
# Run every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key" https://your-domain.com/api/cron/slack-notifications

# Or run every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * * curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key" https://your-domain.com/api/cron/slack-notifications
```

## Monitoring

### Health Check
Test if the cron job endpoint is working:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/slack-notifications
```

### Manual Execution
Run the cron job manually:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/cron/slack-notifications
```

### Logs
Monitor the logs in your application console for:
- `üöÄ [jobId] Cron job started`
- `‚úÖ [jobId] Cron job completed successfully`
- `‚ùå [jobId] Cron job failed`

## Error Handling

The cron job includes several safety features:

1. **Authentication**: Requires `CRON_SECRET` to prevent unauthorized access
2. **No retries**: Failed notifications are marked as sent to prevent infinite retries
3. **Timeout protection**: Batch processing prevents timeouts
4. **Detailed logging**: Each job has a unique ID for tracking

## Frequency Recommendations

- **Development**: Every 10 minutes (`*/10 * * * *`)
- **Production**: Every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`)
- **High volume**: Every 3 minutes (`*/3 * * * *`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **401 Unauthorized**: Check that `CRON_SECRET` is set correctly
2. **500 Internal Server Error**: Check application logs for details
3. **Timeout errors**: Reduce batch size in the notification service
4. **No notifications sent**: Verify brands have Slack enabled and webhook URLs configured

### Debug Steps

1. Check if the cron job is running:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/slack-notifications
   ```

2. Check if there are pending notifications:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/slack-notifications
   ```

3. Check application logs for detailed error messages

## Security Notes

- Keep your `CRON_SECRET` secure and unique
- Use HTTPS for all cron job requests
- Monitor cron job logs for unauthorized access attempts
- Consider rate limiting if needed
