Step 7: Frontend & Reporting â€“ Breakdown Plan
7.1 Brand Setup UI
Allow users to add/edit brands (name, website, etc.)
Allow users to add/edit keywords for each brand
Allow users to configure notification settings (Slack, email)
Use your existing onboarding and keyword components as a starting point
7.2 Mentions Dashboard
Display a list/table of recent mentions for the selected brand
Show key info: content snippet, subreddit, sentiment, timestamp, etc.
Allow filtering by date, sentiment, and keyword
Use your existing dashboard and mention card components as a base
7.3 Sentiment & Trends Visualization
Show sentiment breakdown (positive/negative/neutral) as a chart
Show trends over time (e.g., mentions per day/week)
Use a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts) and your existing chart components
7.4 Brand Switching & Multi-Tenant Support
Allow users to switch between brands (if they have access to more than one)
Ensure all queries and UI are scoped to the selected brand
7.5 Export & Reporting
Allow users to export mention data (CSV, PDF)
(Optional for MVP) Schedule periodic email reports
7.6 UI/UX Polish & Error Handling
Loading states, error messages, empty states
Responsive design and accessibility
How to Proceed
Review your existing mockups and components (onboarding, dashboard, mention card, etc.)
Decide which sub-step to tackle first (e.g., Mentions Dashboard or Brand Setup UI)
For each sub-step:
Reuse and adapt your existing components where possible
Only build new UI where needed
